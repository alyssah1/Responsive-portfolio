Use bootstrap CSS framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio.

First create the following files: index.html, portfolio.html, contact.html

Using bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following: a navbar, a responsive layout, responsive images.

Use bootstrap grid system (containers, rows, and columns).
